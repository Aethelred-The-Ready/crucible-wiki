# Crucible LARP Introduction

### Welcome to Crucible
Crucible is a Live Action Role Playing game where participants play characters in a high fantasy world of humans, elves, dwarves and far more peoples even more fantastical as they battle magical creatures, the undead, and the forces of the elements themselves. The settings is a continuous story where Player Characters gain strength, wealth and knowledge over time against ever changing threats and challenges. 
## Most Important Rules
The following rules are the most important part of this game. No Player, member of Staff or any other participant in the game may violate, change, or limit these rules, even by exception.
### Personal Contact
Due to the nature of the game, all participants consent to limited forms of physical contact such as being struck by soft foam representations of “Weapons” as well as by “Packets”, which are small cloth pouches filled with bird seed or similar filler. Additionally, when skills require one player to touch another, they must do so in the least intrusive way possible, such as on the shoulder or arm. All such contact should be made with a packet whenever possible.
Contact is considered inappropriate if at least one of the involved parties is uncomfortable. The reverse is also true, where parties are free to engage in consensual contact so long as neither party puts the other at risk of injury and local laws are respected.
### Hold
This is a special call that any person can make when there is any perceived risk of injury or there are other concerns which necessitate the game to temporarily stop. Whenever a hold is called all participants must stop where they are, what they’re doing and should not speak until the situation is resolved. It is not acceptable to call a hold to check a rule or ensure a player was affected by an ability unless doing so is vital to all those involved in the encounter.
When the reason for the hold has been resolved, a marshal will call for the game to resume, usually with the statement; “3, 2, 1 Game on!”.
### Fairness of Play
This game requires all Players to be honest in play and treat all other Players with fairness. This means properly counting your hits, not overcasting spells, not using abilities your Character doesn't have, and general honesty in playing the game. Additionally, everyone is expected to not deliberately play in a way that prevents another from enjoying the game. Any player who deliberately cheats, or who’s presence is a consistent detriment to others’ enjoyment of the game will be banned from further attendance.
In Character, you can lie and cheat all you want, but when a Marshal asks you out of game if you stole an item you must answer honestly.
### Theft
Due to various restrictions in place by real world governments and the owners of various game sites there are a number of limitations on how a player can be robbed. Generally speaking it is only possible to steal from a designated in-game area and with the victim’s player’s knowledge. Special “Thievery Marshals” exist for when a Character wants to rob a cabin without its occupants. It is not permitted to “pickpocket” a player, because there is no way to verify that the item being stolen is in game, but it is acceptable to incapacitate and steal from the character while the victim’s player is able to confirm what items are available to be stolen.
### Metagaming
Almost every Player knows things their Character does not. Just because a Player knows exactly how much health a greater fire elemental has does not mean that their potato farmer Character has this information. In general, information which is not included in the Setting Manual, or learned in game, is not known by any Character. Information that a Player learns Out of Game is not known by, and cannot be acted upon by, their Character.
